		<b>Backstory</b><br /> There was once a time, long before humans came
		into existence, when only the elements existed. At first, these
		elements remained in a state of delicate balance but it wasn't long
		before chaos erupted. No one knows when it happened, but at some point
		the elements started to become greedy. Fire, earth, water and air
		began to fight against each other in order to try and further their
		own existence. Eventually these elements manifested into physical
		beings known as mages. To this day, in the darkest areas of the earth,
		these mages still do battle for the sole purpose of total
		dominance....<br />
		<br /> <b>Mage Rage: The 4 Elements</b><br /> Upon joining a new
		game you will be randomly assigned one of 4 random elemental mages.
		These mages are equipped with the power to summon powerful beams of
		concentrated energy. Should these beams collide, at chaotic effect
		will occur.<br />
		<br /> <b>Controls</b><br /> W=Up<br /> A=Left<br /> S=Down<br />
		D=Right<br /> Space=Shoot<br />
		<br /> <b>Beam Collisions</b><br /> Air + Earth = Tornado<br />
		Tornadoes have erratic movement. If a player comes in contact with a
		tornado she will be spun around and flung across the game map.<br />
		<br /> Air + Fire = Lightning.<br /> Lightning will spread out an
		arbitrary distance from its point of generation. If lightning hits a
		player, she will be damaged and there is a chance that it may arc to
		the next closest player.<br />
		<br /> Air + Water = Ice.<br /> A sheet of ice will be generated for
		an arbitrary period of time. A player moving on ice will have lessened
		control.<br />
		<br /> Earth + Fire = Lava.<br /> Lava shall flow for an arbitrary
		period of time, damaging any player that comes into contact with it.<br />
		<br /> Earth + Water = Mud.<br /> A portion of the game map will
		become mired in mud for some period of time. Any player coming into
		contact will be significantly slowed.<br />
		<br /> Fire + Water = Steam.<br /> A cloud of super hot steam will
		be generated; the cloud will drift around the game map for some amount
		of time. Any player coming in contact with the cloud will be damaged.
